<b>About this project:</b><br/> 
This is a rebuild of a page that displays all of the pamphlets and schedules for each annual Florida Folk Festival, which began in 1953. The old page was difficult to navigate so I had to figure out a way to present these in a more logical way. 

<b>Technologies used:</b><br/> 
--Javascript<br/>
--ImageMapster(HTML image mapping plugin: <a>https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster</a>) <br/>
--OpenSeaDragon(high resolution image viewer: <a>https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon</a>)<br/>
--HTML<br/>
--CSS<br/>

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/> 
The most challenging part of this project was figuring out a way to effectively bring together our set of maps, data and documents that donâ€™t always overlap or directly correspond to each other in a logical way. The resulting tool allows a user to choose any modern county, view its entire timeline, and search by year to filter the timeline information and show a map of what the chosen county and the rest of Florida looked like at the time. 

<b>Current status:</b><br/> 
The project is mostly finished and will be implemented on the Florida Memory website, but is awaiting completion while our historian finishes up some of the data used for the county timeline histories.

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
The Florida Department of State is very security focused and version control software is not allowed so you may not see a much of a detailed git history for this project.
