# Florida Folk Festival program viewer
<b>About this project:</b><br/> 
This is a rebuild of a page that displays all of the pamphlets and schedules for each annual Florida Folk Festival, which began in 1953. The old page was difficult to navigate, <a>https://www.floridamemory.com/learn/exhibits/florida-folklife/festival-programs.php<a/>, so I had to figure out a way to present them in a more logical way.  

<b>Technologies used:</b><br/> 
--Javascript<br/>
--HTML<br/>
--CSS<br/>
--PHP<br/>

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/> 
This was a relatively straightforward project, but It was a good exercise in problem solving. The festival has been going on since the 1950s, so I determined that the best way to display them would be to seperates them by decade. There are plenty of ways to do this, but we decided to keep it simple and load them into an accordion. I ended up building an accordion from scratch, as the website is running an old version of bootstrap and we didn't like the accordion from that version. 

<b>Current status:</b><br/> 
The project is complete and will be implemented after a successful communications review. 

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
The Florida Department of State is very security focused and version control software is not allowed so you may not see a much of a detailed git history for this project.
