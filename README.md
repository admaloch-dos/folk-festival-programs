<b>About this Project:</b><br/>
This project was undertaken to revamp a page on the Florida Memory website, showcasing pamphlets and schedules from each annual Florida Folk Festival, dating back to its initial run in 1953. The [existing page](https://www.floridamemory.com/learn/exhibits/florida-folklife/festival-programs.php) posed navigation challenges, prompting a new approach to the design.

<b>Technologies Used:</b><br/>
--<b>Javascript</b><br/>
--<b>HTML</b><br/>
--<b>CSS</b><br/>
--<b>PHP</b> (to be added to the site in a PHP file upon approval)<br/>

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/>
While considered a relatively straightforward project, it served as a valuable exercise in problem-solving. Given the festival's extensive history, spanning back to the 1950s, the most natural layout was to orgnize by decades. Despite multiple approaches available, we kept it simple with an accordion layout. Notably, we did not use Bootstrap for the accordion, as it is an older version of bootstrap with a jenky accordion. 

<b>Current Status:</b><br/>
The project has reached completion and awaits implementation following a successful communications review.

<b>Note:</b><br/>
The Florida Department of State places a strong emphasis on security, and version control software is restricted. Consequently, a detailed git history for this project may not be readily available.
